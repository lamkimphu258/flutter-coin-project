# Introduction

This is a Crypto Portfolio Tracker using public API from Coingecko. This app contains 4 screens:
home screen, trending screen, news screen and recent screen.

## Home Screen

This screen will list all the available coin icons, coin name and current price of that coin in USD.
When user click to specific coin, app will navigate theme to detail page of that coin so that user
can see more information of that coin.

## Trending Screen

This screen will show all the trending coin icons, coin name and current rank of that coin.

## Recent Screen

This screen will show all the coins which user have just seen. Unfortunately, we don't have enough
time to complete this screen. So we just have a place holder for it.
